## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

To obtain an API key through the [Privvy dashboard](https://privvy.xyz/auth), please contact our support team.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and maintain service quality, our API implements rate limiting. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response. Please refer to the response headers for information on your current rate limit status.

## Error Handling

Our API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. Codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g., missing required parameters, invalid values), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with our servers.
