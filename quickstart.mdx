This guide will help you quickly get up and running with the Privvy API.

## Step 1: Obtain an API Key

1. Sign up for a Privvy account at [https://privvy.xyz/auth](https://privvy.xyz/auth).
2. Navigate to the dashboard and generate an API key.

## Step 2: Create a Agent

Agents help organize your data. Let's create one:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.privvy.xyz/agent' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
-d '{"name": "My First Agent"}'
```

Save the `id` from the response for later use.

## Step 3: Add a Source

Now, let's add a URL source to your agent:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.privvy.xyz/source/url' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
-d '{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "autoUpdate": true,
  "agentId": "YOUR_AGENT_ID"
}'
```

## Step 4: Retrieve Information

After adding a source, you can retrieve information from it:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.privvy.xyz/retrieve' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
-d '{
  "content": "What is the main topic of the website?",
  "agentId": "YOUR_AGENT_ID"
}'
```

This will return relevant chunks of information based on your query.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've now created a agent, added a source, and retrieved information using the Privvy API. Here are some next steps:

- Explore other source types like plain text or PDF
- Learn about advanced retrieval options like reranking and query expansion
- Integrate the API into your application
